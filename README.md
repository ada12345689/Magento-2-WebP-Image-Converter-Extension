# Magento-2-WebP-Image-Converter-Extension

Convert your website images into lower-sized WebP images without compromising the image quality by using Magento 2 WebP Image Converter. With the help of this extension, the chances of getting any Serve images in next-gen formats issues that are mainly addressed for JPEG or Png images by Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool are reduced. Hence, the user experience, SEO performance, and page loading speed are improved.

If the website is loaded with JPEG, PNG, or any other format images, then the site might take longer to load than usual, and the PageSpeed Insights tool starts to display the “serve in next-gen formats” error. This is why, WebP images are highly recommended by Google, as they offer low-sized but high-resolution images for better website performance.
